# PolyEdge — Implementation Status & Known Gaps

**Last Updated**: 2026-04-11

## Summary

This document tracks what is implemented, what was intentionally de-scoped, and what remains incomplete. It is the honest source of truth — no false "100% Complete" claims.

---

## Backend

### Fully Implemented
- 9 trading strategies registered and executing (BTC Momentum, Weather EMOS, Copy Trader, Market Maker, Kalshi Arb, Bond Scanner, BTC Oracle, Whale PNL Tracker, Realtime Scanner)
- Polymarket CLOB integration via `py-clob-client` and `py-order-utils`
- Kalshi REST API client (`backend/data/kalshi_client.py`)
- AI ensemble layer with Claude, Groq, and custom providers
- Risk manager with position limits and circuit breakers
- Settlement tracking and P&L reconciliation
- Shadow mode (paper trading) with virtual bankroll
- Job queue with Redis primary and SQLite fallback
- APScheduler for recurring strategy scans
- Prometheus metrics endpoint and monitoring middleware
- WebSocket market data client (`ws_client.py`)
- **AGI Intelligence Layer**: Research Pipeline, Debate Engine, Self-Review, and Self-Improvement modules

### Intentionally De-Scoped
- **Email notifications**: `notification_router.py` routes to Telegram and Discord only. Email channel raises `NotImplementedError` — this is a deliberate design choice, not a bug. Telegram and Discord cover all notification needs.

### Fixed (April 2026 Audit)
- Pydantic v2 `ConfigDict` migration (was using deprecated `class Config`)
- SQLAlchemy 2.0 `declarative_base` import (was using deprecated `ext.declarative`)
- FastAPI lifespan context manager (was using deprecated `@app.on_event`)
- `inspect.iscoroutinefunction` (was using deprecated `asyncio.iscoroutinefunction`)
- Market maker inventory tracking now queries real database (was returning placeholder `0`)
- WebSocket `subscribe()` method is now properly `async` with `await`
- Backend deprecation warnings reduced from ~69,000 to 17

### Known Gaps — Backend
- **Exception handling**: 306 bare `except Exception` blocks across 77 files. Critical-path modules (orchestrator, order_executor, risk_manager, strategy_executor, api/main, polymarket_clob, settlement_helpers) are being audited for structured error logging. Remaining non-critical files are lower priority.
- **Database migrations**: No Alembic setup. Schema changes require manual SQLite operations or fresh DB creation.
- **Kalshi API**: Market data endpoint returned 404 during testing. Kalshi integration may need API key updates or endpoint verification.
- **Polymarket Testnet Clarification**: The Polymarket Builder Program operates on MAINNET (chain_id=137), not a separate testnet. The "testnet" mode in PolyEdge uses mainnet CLOB with Builder auth for gasless trading. There is no functional testnet CLOB host (clob-staging.polymarket.com returns 503). Testnet trades are REAL but gasless; track separately from paper/live modes.

## Frontend

### Fully Implemented
- React 18 + TypeScript + Vite dashboard
- TanStack Query for server state management
- Dashboard overview, signals table, trades table, admin controls
- GlobeView 3D map component (Three.js / react-three-fiber)
- Playwright E2E test suite
- Vitest unit test suite (9 files, 36 tests — all passing)

### Fixed (April 2026 Audit)
- Vitest config now includes correct `src/**/*.test.{ts,tsx}` pattern (was picking up Playwright e2e files)
- OpportunityScanner test mocks `../api` module instead of global `fetch`
- WhaleActivityFeed test mocks `../api` module instead of global `fetch`
- PendingApprovals test wraps component with `QueryClientProvider`

### Known Gaps — Frontend
- **Bundle size**: GlobeView chunk is ~1.8MB, index.js is ~950KB. Needs code splitting via `React.lazy()` and Vite manual chunks to get all chunks under 500KB.
- **Offline/error states**: Some components lack loading skeletons and error boundaries.

---

## Infrastructure

### Implemented
- Docker Compose (app + Redis)
- Railway deployment config (`railway.json`)
- Vercel frontend deployment (`vercel.json`)
- PM2 process manager (API + worker + scheduler)
- GitHub Actions CI pipeline
- `.env.example` with all required variables documented

### Known Gaps — Infrastructure
- **Grafana dashboards**: Prometheus metrics are collected but no dashboards are configured. Future work.
- **Log aggregation**: Structured logging exists but no centralized log collection (e.g., Loki, CloudWatch).
- **Health checks**: Basic `/health` endpoint exists but no deep dependency checks (DB, Redis, external APIs).

---

## Documentation

### Current State
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` — Accurate system architecture, directory structure, data flow, strategies (rewritten April 2026)
- `README.md` — Project overview, quick start, architecture diagram, doc links
- `docs/how-it-works.md` — Strategy explanations
- `docs/api.md` — API endpoint reference
- `docs/configuration.md` — Environment variables
- `docs/data-sources.md` — Data provider documentation
- `docs/project-structure.md` — Codebase layout
- `docs/architecture/adr-001-job-queue.md` — Job queue design decision

### Known Gaps — Documentation
- `docs/project-structure.md` may be slightly outdated relative to recent file additions
- No runbook for production operations (deployment, rollback, incident response)

## Future Work (Not In Current Scope)

1. **Alembic migrations** — Proper schema versioning for production database changes
2. **Grafana dashboards** — Visual monitoring for Prometheus metrics
3. **Full exception audit** — Cover remaining ~250 bare `except Exception` blocks in non-critical modules
4. **Frontend code splitting** — Lazy-load GlobeView and heavy chart components
5. **Kalshi live trading validation** — Verify API endpoints with active credentials
6. **Load testing** — Stress test concurrent strategy execution and API throughput
