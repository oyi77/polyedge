## What is PolyEdge?

PolyEdge is an **automated trading bot** that trades on **prediction markets** like Polymarket. 

**What are prediction markets?** 
Think of them as betting on real-world events. Instead of betting on sports, you're betting on questions like:
- "Will Bitcoin be above $100,000 on Friday?"
- "Will the temperature in NYC exceed 80°F tomorrow?"
- "Will a certain candidate win an election?"

**What does the bot do?**
The bot analyzes data (weather forecasts, Bitcoin price trends, news) and finds opportunities where the market price seems "wrong." If the bot thinks there's a 70% chance of rain but the market says 50%, that's an opportunity to profit.

## How the Bot Makes Money

1. **Data Analysis**: The bot gathers data (weather forecasts, price trends, news)
2. **Probability Estimate**: It calculates what it thinks the true probability is
3. **Edge Detection**: It compares its estimate to the market price
4. **Trade Decision**: If the edge is big enough (e.g., >5%), it considers trading
5. **Size Calculation**: It uses Kelly Criterion to decide how much to bet
6. **Execution**: It places the trade (or waits for your approval)
7. **Settlement**: When the event happens, you win or lose based on the outcome

**Example:**
- Market question: "Will BTC be above $100K on Friday?"
- Market price: 60 cents (implies 60% chance)
- Bot's estimate: 75% chance based on momentum analysis
- Edge: 75% - 60% = 15% edge
- Action: Buy YES at 60 cents
- If BTC is above $100K: You get $1.00 back (40 cent profit)
- If BTC is below $100K: You lose your 60 cents

## Safety Tips for Beginners

1. **Start with Paper Mode**: Always test with fake money first
2. **Small Bankroll**: When going live, start with $25-50 you can afford to lose
3. **Set Loss Limits**: Configure daily loss limits to prevent big losses
4. **Manual Approval**: Keep auto-approve OFF and review each trade
5. **Understand Before Trading**: Read the bot's reasoning in the Decisions tab
6. **Check Calibration**: A well-calibrated bot should be right about as often as its confidence suggests
7. **Diversify**: Don't put all your money on one strategy or market
