"""
Self-Debate Engine (Bull/Bear/Judge) — RA-CR Protocol.

Implements a multi-agent debate for prediction market analysis:
  1. Bull agent argues FOR the market resolving YES (higher probability)
  2. Bear agent argues AGAINST (lower probability)
  3. They debate for 1-2 rounds, responding to each other's arguments
  4. Judge agent synthesizes both sides into a final consensus

Cost routing via LLMRouter:
  - Bull/Bear: cheap model (role="debate_agent" → Groq by default)
  - Judge: smart model (role="judge" → Claude when available, Groq fallback)

References:
  - RA-CR (Retrieval-Augmented Conversational Reasoning) protocol
  - Multi-agent debate for improved LLM factuality
